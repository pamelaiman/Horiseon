# Accessible Horiseon Website


## Description


In this project, I was required to modify a HTML starter code and make it more accessible. This was done so the website can be used by different search engines as well as those with modified browsers including people using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. I learned how to incorprate semantic HTML elements as well as alt attributes. Image of website application can be found in folder ../assets/images/horiseonwebsite. Website application available at https://pamelaiman.github.io/horiseonrepo/

## Usage


The website is accessible in the repository, as well as the code itself. Additionally, Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows) opens a console box to identify the code.
